  // now that we have a way to check via state whether a user is signed in, it's time to update our header! We want to show the "My Favorites" and "Sign out" links when authenticated is set to true, and also want to fire the signOutUser() action creator whenever the "Sign out" link is clicked:
  handleSignout() {
    this.props.signOutUser();
  }

  // Here, we're extracting away the conditional logic needed to render our links into its own method. authenticated is being made available from our AuthReducer via mapStateToProps, and if it's set to true, we return our links to "My Favorites" and "Sign Out", since that's what signed-in users should see.
  // But why are we returning an array of <li>s? On any sort of React render() method, we have to return a single element, which is why we're always wrapping things in <div> tags. However, wrapping a group of <li>s within a <div> inside of a <ul> isn't very clean markup.
  // We can instead return an array of comma-separated <li>s, and React will just list them in order. The only thing we need in order to do this is to give them a key prop so that they are unique.
  // Notice that our "Sign Out" link isn't a <Link> tag but instead a normal <a> element. This is because we're not actually routing anywhere when this link is clicked; instead, we're calling the handleSignout() method to fire our signOutUser() action creator.
